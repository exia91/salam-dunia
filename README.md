your start to a journey of a lifetime.


hello, 

setsuna f. seiei here. former gundam meister. i died during the great war vs the metallic-kinda-shit-ass aliens. i used the best gundam ever built; the quanta gundam just once and and then blew it off. some people call it and absolute waste of gundam and they aren't wrong. 
so, anyhoo. this is my first time here and i hope that coding will begin to be a huge part of my life, a craft to be perfected. 

i know that i will suck ass at the beginning, but with time i will prevail. i'm destined for greatness, and i know i can make a change in this world in this short time of mine.
